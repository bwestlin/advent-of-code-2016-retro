# Advent of Code 2016 done retrospectively

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016/) written in some yet undefined languages.

This is a fun activity we decided to do at work where we met up every week to discuss the solutions, while the solutions themselves were done during spare time. As we also are comparing the solutions in terms of execution speed my solutions will be oriented towards that.
This acivity is still ongoing so the current state shows where we currently are at.

I haven't decided yet if I will use different languages as spare time is limited, so far I've only been doing them in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

For more info on the rust solutions see: [rust](rust)

#### To run solution for a given day for in a given language: (day 01 and rust below)

```
./run.sh rust 01
```
