# Advent of Code 2016 done retrospectively in Rust

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016/) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

#### To run solution for a given day: (day 01 below)

```
./run.sh 01
```
Optionally `print` can be passed as the second argument for debug output.

#### To run tests for a solution:

```
./test.sh 01
```
Optionally `print` can be passed as the second argument for debug output here as well.

#### Prerequisites

* Rust installation (tested with v1.38.0), see: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
* For test script [cargo-watch](https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch) is used. Just `cargo install cargo-watch` is needed.
